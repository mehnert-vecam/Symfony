Contributing
============

Thank you for contributing to BraincraftedBootstrapBundle.

Here are a few rules to make code reviews and merging your code into the repository easier.

You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). If you don't know about them, read the recommendations. You can use
[PHP-CS-Fixer tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to find errors in your code.

You MUST run the test suite.

You MUST write (or update) unit tests.

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

If asked, [squash your
commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html). This is used to "clean" your Pull
Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Thank you!
